# Big Mart Sales forecats Regressor
A Regressor model on the Big mart sales dataset from kaggle source, analysed the data thrugh visualization by univariate and bivariate analysis.

Data preprocessing by filling the nulls and preparing the data for the ML models

Developed a linear regressor, Decision tree, Random forest regressor, xgboost regressor models and getting the best model.


## source of datset

 - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data)
 


## Roadmap

- understanding the data

- Data visualization

- Data preprocessing

- Model selection

- developing the respective models

- validating the models 

- Hyper parameter tuning with the gridsearchcv

- best model propossing
